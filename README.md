Sumo Logic Query Profiler
=========================

Want to know where you are spending your time on complex queries?

Want to see if you can optimize your data analysis methods?

Then Query Profiler is probably for you.

Installing the Scripts
=======================

The scripts are command line based, designed to be used within a batch script or DevOPs tool such as Chef or Ansible.
Written in python3, all scripts are listed below, and there is a Pipfile to show what modules are required to run.

You will need to use Python 3.6 or higher and the modules listed in the dependency section.  

Please follow the following steps to install:

    1. Download and install python 3.6 or higher from python.org. Append python3 to the LIB and PATH env.

    2. Download and install git for your platform if you don't already have it installed.
       It can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    3. Open a new shell/command prompt. It must be new since only a new shell will include the new python 
       path that was created in step 1. Cd to the folder where you want to install the scripts.
    
    4. Execute the following command to install pipenv, which will manage all of the library dependencies:
    
        sudo -H pip3 install pipenv 
 
    5. Clone this repository. This will create a new folder

    6. Change into the new folder. Type the following to install all the package dependencies 
       (this may take a while as this will download all of the libraries required):

        pipenv install
